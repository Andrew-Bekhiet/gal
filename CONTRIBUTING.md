# 💚 Contribution Guide

Welcome to the Gal contribution guide. Feel free to create issue or PR.

## 🙋‍♀️ Question

You should use the [Discussions](https://github.com/natsuk4ze/gal/discussions).
  
## 🐝 Others

You can use the [Issue](https://github.com/natsuk4ze/gal/issues).
Basically, please submit the issue before the PR. However, if the change does not affect the plugin, 
such as the following changes, the issue submission is exempt.

- example code
- markdown
- comments

> 💡 Creating an issue before submitting a PR may seem like a long way off, but in many cases, creating an issue is the quickest route to resolution, as submitting a direct PR takes longer to review.

## 🎯 Management Policy

### 1. Maintainability > Backward compatibility.

Expanding the code base and adding numerous test cases to preserve backward compatibility can lead to a decline in the overall maintainability of the project. 
In the worst-case scenario, this could result in the project being neglected entirely. 
Numerous community plugins have faced this issue, and it is imperative that this plugin does not repeat the same mistake.

Consequently, to safeguard the project, we may occasionally need to sacrifice compatibility with a small percentage of outdated device shares. 
This decision, though difficult, is essential to ensure the long-term viability and health of the project.
